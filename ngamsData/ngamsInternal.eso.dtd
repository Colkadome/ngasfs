  The ngamsInternal.dtd defines various common elements to be used
  in the NG/AMS XML documents.
  -->


<!-- 
  The Ngams Element defines properties for the individual
  installation of NG/AMS. 

  Attributes:
    ArchiveName:            Name of the archive - e.g. ESO-VLT.

    PortNo:                 Port number to use for the NG/AMS HTTP server.

    SwVersion:	            If defined, NG/AMS will compare the value of
                            this attribute with the version ID of NG/AMS.
                            If these are not completely identical an error
                            is reported and the NG/AMS Server will perform
                            an exit. If the SwVersion is not specified
                            (set to ""), this check is not done.

    OnlinePlugIn:           Plug-In utility invoked by NG/AMS when
                            going Online to prepare the system and to
                            obtain the information about the current
                            disk configuration and status of the disks.

    OnlinePlugInPars:       Input parameters to the Online Plug-In.

    OfflinePlugIn:          Plug-In utility invoked by NG/AMS when
                            going Offline to prepare the system for
                            standby mode.

    OfflinePlugInPars:      Input parameters to the Online Plug-In.

    Replication:            Indicates if file replication should be 
                            carried out by this NG/AMS (0|1).

    BlockSize:              Block size applied when receiving and
                            sending data via HTTP (bytes).

    Simulation:             Simulation system "1" otherwise "0".

    MountRootDirectory:     Base directory used as root directory when
                            mounting the disks.
			     
    AllowArchiveReq:        Allow clients to issue Archive Requests
                            to the system (0|1).

    AllowRetrieveReq:       Allow clients to retrieve data from this
                            NG/AMS installation (0|1).

    AllowProcessingReq:     Allow clients to perform processing requests
                            on this NG/AMS installation (0|1).

    AllowRemoveReq:         Allow clients to carry out REMFILE and REMDISK
                            commands (0|1).

    ForceProxyMode:         If a server which is contacted with a Retrieve
                            Request, finds a file to be retrieved, on 
                            another NGAS Host, it will act as proxy and
                            send back the file to the requestor if
                            possible.

    JanitorSuspendTime:     Period of time the Janitor Thread is suspended
                            after each iteration. Should be given as
                            '<days>T<hours>:<minutes>:<seconds>'.

<!-- 
  The StorageSet Element defines properties for each 'storage unit', 
  consisting of two disks (Main Disk and Replication Disk).

  Attributes:
    StorageSetId:       ID used to refer to this particular 
                        storage unit (string).

    DiskLabel:          Name of label prefix to put on the

    Mutex:              Indicates if mutual exclusion access should be

                        one data reception session will write data to
                        that slot (disk), and not simultaneous as otherwise 
                        done if several files for the same disk is received 
                        at the same time. 1 = mutual exclusion (integer).

    Synchronize:        The synchronize flag is used to indicate if the two

                        together so that when one is completed also
                        the other is marked as completed although it

<!-- 
  The FileHandling Element defines properties for the file handling.

  Attributes:
    ProcessingDirectory:  Base directory in which temporary files
                          will be stored during processing.

    PathPrefix:           A prefix which will be used when building up the
                          target filename. Could e.g. be used as to build
                          a filename like:

                          <mount point>/<PathPrefix>/<add. path>/<filename>

                          - but it is up to the Data Handling Plug-In
                          to use it in a way appropriate for the context.

   ChecksumPlugIn:        DCPI - Data Checksum Plug-In, which generates the
                          checksum of a data file.

   ChecksumPlugInPars:    Input parameters to the DCPI.

   DataCheckActive:       Enable/disable Data Check Service (1 = activate).

   DataCheckPrio:         Priority of Data Check Thread (1 = highest priority).
                          with this parameter it is possible to adjust the
                          amount of CPU power the Data Check Thread should 
                          consume. The higher the number, the lesser CPU
                          the check will consume. At the same time, it
                          will take more time to carry out the check of
                          the data holding.

   DataCheckMinCycle:     Indicates the minimum allowed time for carrying out
                          one check cycle (ddThh:mm:ss). If this is specified
                          e.g. to 24 hours, and one check cycle would only
                          take 11 hours, the check would be suspended for
                          13 hours before running again.

   DataCheckDiskSeq:      Used to indicate if disks should be checked
                          sequentially (ordered according to the Slot
                          ID), or randomly (SEQUENTIAL|RANDOM).

   DataCheckFileSeq:      Used to indicate if files on a disk should be checked
                          sequentially (ordered according to the ingestion
                          date), or randomly (SEQUENTIAL|RANDOM).

   DataCheckLogSummary:   If set to 1, a summary log info will be generated
                          each time a complete check of the data holding
                          of one NGAS Host has been carried out.
